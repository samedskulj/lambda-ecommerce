# Lambda-eCommerce-MERN
ECommerce website based around selling tech products all around the world. This website is fully made by using the MERN Stack

# Why it is made?

Here is why: 
* Improving MERN Stack knowledge as a junior fullstack developer
* To develop knowledge in databases
* Making sure to know how exactly everything works in the app.

# How to use the app
In this paragraph I will try to describe you how to use the app, if you want to work on it.

# Usage

There are three sections on this website:
* Main screen
* Products screen
* Cart Screen
* Profile Screen

### Main screen 

On the main screen you can see all about the website itself and all of the benefits this E-Commerce site has. The whole main screen of the website and the UI design can be found on the Behance site. It is made entirely by me!

### Products screen
On this screen, you can see all of the products this site has. There are also pages so you wont have every product on the one page, so you can safely look at them. Also there is the header, where you can search the product (it is not case-sensitive), the link for log in if you have not done that, and a button for a drawer menu.

### Cart Screen
To be honest this is the most imporant route of the site. After you have successfully bought something (maybe Iphone, who knows), you will need to enter your information according to the title. The input fields and everything is connected to the database, and local storage which is great. Why? Well, you will not need to enter those information again if you have entered them once. After you completed that, you will need to pay. The site only supports PayPal, MasterCard and Visa, but in the future maybe something new will be added, crypto for example

### Profile Screen
As the name says you can check out your profile information in the menu. You can also change them if you want, as well as the all of orders you have made.
